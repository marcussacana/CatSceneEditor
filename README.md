Support CST, CSTL, INT

Tested With: Grisaia no Kajitsu; Nekopara vol.3

## Notes:
Debug Enabler Tools under testing, any bug, report it.

The Tool can Extract and Repack Int's only without encryption.


### Debugger Enabler:
This patch fuck the debug key validation and allow run with other game...

Before apply the patch, extract all encrypted Int's and Repack without Encryption.

I recommend too, delete the "startup.xml" located in the SAVE directory, the SAVE and not the CONFIG
